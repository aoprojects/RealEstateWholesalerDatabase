	 <br>
	 <br>
	SECTION 13 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY<br>
	 <br>

	 <br>
	We do not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable.<br>

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.<br>

	 <br>
	In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.<br>

	 <br>
	SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT<br>
	 <br>
	The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br>

	<p><i> This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their "Personally identifiable information" (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. </i></p>

	<h5>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</h5>

	<p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, business name or other details to help you with your experience.</p>

	<h5>When do we collect information?</h5>

	<p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form or enter information on our site.</p>

	<h5>How do we use your information?</h5>

	<p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:<br>
	      - To personalize user's experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</br>

	      - To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.<br>
	      - To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.<br>
	      - To quickly process your transactions.<br>
	      - To send periodic emails regarding your order or other products and services.
	</p>

	<h5>How do we protect visitor information?</h5>

	<p>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.</p>
	<p>We do not use Malware Scanning.</p>
	<p>We do not use an SSL certificate.<br>
	      - We do not need an SSL because your credit card information is instead handled by the credit card processing service, <%= link_to 'Stripe', "https://stripe.com/", target: "_none" %>, which does have an SSL certificate and is PCI Compliant.</p>


	<h5>Do we use 'cookies'?</h5>

	<p>Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information that may be helpful in providing you a better user experience. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They may also be used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services and relevant site updates. We may also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

	<h5>We may use cookies to:</h5>
	    <p>
			- Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.<br>
			- Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.
		</p>


	<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

	<h5>If users disable cookies in their browser:</h5>

	<p>If you disable cookies, some features may be disabled, and some of the features that contribute to your optimal site experience may be less efficient/some of our services will not function properly.</p>

	<p>However, you can still place orders, make account changes, and operate functionally within the site.</p>

	<h5>Third Party Disclosure</h5>

	<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

	<p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

	<h5>Third party links</h5>

	<p>At our discretion, we may choose to include or offer third party products or services on our website. These services may also directly be advertised on our site.  We do not specifically endorse or vet any of these sites before allowing them to advertise their services.  These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies, and general business practices or standards than we do. We have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these advertised or linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.  You may submit feedback to us through out <%= link_to 'Contact Us', about_path %> page.</p>

	<h5>Google</h5>

	<p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. (See more by clicking <%= link_to 'HERE', "https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en", target: "_none" %> .) </p>

	<p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>

	<h5>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h5>

	<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. (See more by clicking <%= link_to 'HERE', "http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf", target: "_none" %>.) </p>

	<h5>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h5>

	<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
	<p>After this privacy policy has beencreated, there will be a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
	<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
	<p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our privacy policy page.</p>  
	<p>Users are able to change their personal information by logging into their account.</p>

	<h5>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h5>

	<p>We don't honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don't honor them because we are currently in beta mode and we do not track enough data to need such DNT systems in place.</p>

	<h5>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h5>
	<p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.</p>

	<h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>

	<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

	<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

	<h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>

	<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

	<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:  We will notify the users via in site notification<br>
			-  as soon as we are aware and able, either via email or via a post on our site itself</p>
		

	<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

	<h5>CAN SPAM Act</h5>

	<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

	<p>We collect your email address in order to deliver relevant content to you; including but not limited to keeping you updated with new changes or additions to the site, notify you of promotions, manage your security (eg. forgotten passwords), etc..</p>

	<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</p>

	<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at team@rewholesalerdatabase.com with the subject line “REMOVE ME” and we will promptly remove you from all email correspondence.</p>
