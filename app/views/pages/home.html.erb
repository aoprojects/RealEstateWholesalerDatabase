    <h4><strong>What is Real Estate Wholesaling?</strong></h4>
    <br>
    <p>Real estate wholesaling is the most popular and widely-taught method of breaking into the real estate investing scene.   With little or no money down, you can 'easily' make $10,000 in profit. Just follow these steps: <br>
    <div class="internal-list">
         1. Put a property under contract for a cash purchase, usually a property that needs a lot of work or where the seller is in distress. (make sure this contract is assignable)<br>
         2. You  assign the contract to a cash buyer who wants to flip the property, who will pay slightly more for it than what you have it under contract for <br>
         3. All three parties directly involved in the transaction set up a closing date, and at closing you walk away with a check for the difference between the initial contract and the marked up price that the end user pays. 
            <br><br>
         <em>The wholesaler walks away with what usually resembles a profit (aka "finder's fee"), of about 10% of the initial contract price.</em>
    </div><!--end .internal-list -->
         <br>
        Investors like buying from wholesalers because they are experts in their market, they have a lot of properties to choose from, and the job of finding the deal is done for them.  All the investor has to do is flip the house for a profit.  <br><br>
        <span class="blue text-center">Find wholesalers in your market by selecting your preferred location above.</span>
        </p><br><br>


        <h4><strong>Why did we make this site?</strong></h4>
        <p>We are real estate investors who went through a lot of investment programs taught by "gurus". They said it was easy to start by wholesaling. It was not.</p>
        <p>Wholesaling is about knowing other investors, and we got tired of the networking process.</p>
        <p>Here's why...</p>
        
        <p><b>When we were selling, we got tired of:</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>printing out property fliers, attend REIAs (Real Estate Investment Association meetings), giving out the property flier, asking for business cards, having to resend the property flier to those emails</li>
            <li>posting on craigslist at least once a day, each day with a different headline, hoping to catch the right investment buyer's eye.</li>
            <li>asking agents if they have investors in the area who are looking for our type of deal, and finding out that their buyer's list wasn't actually full of investors</li>
            <li>showing our properties to prospective buyers, only to have them turn it down because their private funding didn't work out</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>When we were buying, we got tired of:</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>running into newbies who didn't have properties.</li> 
            <li>getting mailed properties that didn't fit our buying criteria.</li>
            <li>going to networking events in hopes of finding someone who actually had an available property in our market that fit our criteria, and finding out that there were none in the room. Again.</li>
            <li>going to REIAs and explaining our buying criteria again and again.</li>
            <li>responding to property ads on Craigslist, only to find out that the property is unavailable</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p class="text-center blue">Finally, we decieded that buying and selling properties shouldn't be annoying.</p><br>

        <span class="align-center">
           
            <p><b>So let's do this right. </b></p>

            &nbsp;or&nbsp; 
            <%= link_to "View Wholesalers", root_path, class: "btn btn-primary btn-md" %></p>
