	<p> TODO: Note to self. They should not be charged extra for updating things., unless they are changing the type of listing they are making to one of a resource from one of a wholesaler. Or maybe they shouldn't even be able to do that. Maybe they should just be able to create a category of listing and not change the type of listing from the two main types. </p>
